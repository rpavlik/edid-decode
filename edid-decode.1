.SH NAME
edid-decode - Decode EDID data in human-readable format
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B edid-decode <options> [in [out]]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B edid-decode
decodes EDID monitor description data in human-readable format.
If [in] is not given, or [in] is '-', then the EDID will be read from
standard input. If [out] is given then the EDID that was read from [in]
is written to [out] or to standard output if [out] is '-'. By default
the output is written as a hex dump when writing to standard output or
a raw EDID if written to a file.

If [out] is given then edid-decode only does the conversion, it will
skip the decoding step.
.PP
Input files may be raw binaries or ASCII text.  ASCII input is scanned for
hex dumps; heuristics are included to search for hexdumps in
.B edid-decode(1)
output (as long as the initial hex dump was included),
.B xrandr(1)
property output and
.B Xorg(1)
log file formats, otherwise the data is treated as a raw hexdump.  EDID blocks
for connected monitors can be found in
.B /sys/class/drm/*/edid
on modern Linux systems with kernel modesetting support.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR
Prints the help message.
.TP
\fB\-o\fR, \fB\-\-output\-format\fR=\fI<fmt>\fR
If [out] is specified, then write the EDID in format \fI<fmt>\fR.
.br
The output format can be one of:
.br
hex: hex numbers in ascii text (default for stdout)
.br
raw: binary data (default unless writing to stdout)
.br
carray: c-program struct
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
Check if the EDID conforms to the standards. Warnings and failures are
reported at the end.
.TP
\fB\-C\fR, \fB\-\-check\-inline\fR
Check if the EDID conforms to the standards. Warnings and failures are
reported as they happen.
.TP
\fB\-s\fR, \fB\-\-skip\-hex\-dump\fR
Skip the initial hex dump of the EDID.
.TP
\fB\-e\fR, \fB\-\-extract\fR
Extract the contents of the first block in hex values.
This was always done in old edid-decode versions. To get
the same behavior add this option.

.PP
.SH NOTES
Not all fields are decoded, or decoded completely.  Some fields' decoding
may appear to corrupt the output (for example, detailed string sections
have their contents printed literally).
.B edid-decode
does attempt to validate its input against the relevant standards, but its
opinions have not been double-checked with the relevant standards bodies,
so they may be wrong.  Do not rely on the output format, as it will likely
change in future versions of the tool as additional fields and extensions are
added.
