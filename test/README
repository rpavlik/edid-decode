This test directory contains some special test EDIDs:

Three test files to check the edid-decode file parser:

quantumdata.test: an EDID as generated by the QuantumData (nowadays
	Teledyne LeCroy) software.

xorg.test: an EDID as logged by xorg in /var/log/Xorg.0.log.

xrandr.test: an EDID as reported by 'xrandr --props'.


Four hand-crafted EDIDs to test rarely seen EDID extensions or data blocks:

cta-vesa.test: has VESA Display Transfer Characteristics Data Block and
	VESA Video Display Device Data Block in the CTA-861 block.

ls-ext.test: has a Localized String Extension Block.

blockmap-128.test: has a single Block Map extension and a total of
	128 blocks.

blockmap-256.test: has a single Block Map extension and a total of
	256 blocks (the maximum possible EDID size).


Examples of old EDID versions:

edid-1.X.test: EDIDs with version 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2.
